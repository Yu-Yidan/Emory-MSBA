        <p>I had three years of work experience as a senior associate in Audit and Assurance department, including experience in Audit Analytics. I worked with cross-border teams to provide assurance on financial statements of clients across various industries, including hospitality, technology as well as chemical industry. I pioneered the use of Visual Basic for Applications in Excel for two large audit engagements that greatly improved audit efficiency. When I was in Audit Analytics team, I applied SQL, Python and QlikView to perform data manipulation and visualization to identify audit risk areas.<br>
            I am a Chartered Accountant of Singapore. However, my interest in business analytics extends beyond financial industry and it led me into pursuing the Master of Science in Business Analytics at Emory University.</p>
